## Configuration and actual use are different checks

Google and GitHub are configured for Noteweld's public domain. Authorization request checks passed the exact callback URL, state and PKCE; Google also includes its OIDC nonce. Ordinary email sign-in and authenticated note/account operations passed the deployed release checks.

The owner's actual provider consent, linking/unlinking, cancellation and provider-specific email cases have not yet completed acceptance. Do not interpret configuration as evidence that every external account has been exercised.

## Existing account? Link deliberately

First sign in using the method that already owns your notes. Then open **Account → Sessions and connected sign-in → Provider identities**, confirm ownership if asked and choose the desired provider. If ownership confirmation has expired, the action remains clickable and guides you to the confirmation field. Confirm using your passphrase or private recovery key and retry the action. Google linking requests an explicit account choice. Matching email addresses do not automatically combine accounts.

[Account controls and recovery](/manuals/noteweld/account-work/) describe the supported safety controls. The [usage guide](/manuals/noteweld/guide/) is the normal starting point.
